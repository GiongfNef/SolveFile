Actually, I use sagemath instead of python for this circumstance. When i calculated sqrt by python it cant convert float to int, so i try to change the number's structure and it led to one of my operations had precision problems . This is the consequence flag{6t............ while the correct one is flag{6r1t15h_cr0s5_ .
