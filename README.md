Actually, i use sagemath instead of python for this circumstance. When i calculated sqrt by python it cant covert float to int, i try to change structure of number and it lead to one of my operations has precision problems . This is consequence flag{6t............ while the correct one is flag{6r1t15h_cr0s5_ .
